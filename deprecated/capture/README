This directory is only for Linux.

You need following packages to make everything:

- ffmpeg
- SDL
- SDL_image
- SDL_ttf
- gflags
- glog

And the following two libraries are optional:

- v4l2 (for video capture)
- gtest (for unittest)

If your glog version is <0.3.3, you may need to install glog from
source code as most distributors don't link glog with gflags. Please
install it by

svn checkout http://google-glog.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ google-glog-read-only
cd google-glog-read-only
./configure
make
sudo make install


If you are using PCA-DAV2, you need recent kernel (my kernel is 3.6.11,
and it didn't work with 2.x) and run modprobe with card=29 option:

$ sudo modprobe em28xx card=29

As resolution negotiation isn't implemented yet, you need to run

$ xawtv -device /dev/video0

to adjust the resolution of driver.
